REST，比SOAP和WSDL更好的API方案。

RESTful API：

GET = load/retrieve
POST = create
PUT = update
DELETE = delete

api/users
api/users/[id]


GET   /api/users – List all users
GET   /api/users/1 – List info for user with ID of 1
POST   /api/users – Create a new user
PUT   /api/users/1 – Update user with ID of 1
DELETE   /api/users/1 – Delete user with ID of 1

//TOHERE So, REST handles requests very easily, but it also makes generating responses easy.
